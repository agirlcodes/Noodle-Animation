# animation

This animation is a logo inspired by a  website I am building. The website is a recipe page, therefore, the best way to represent food is by using food!.
This animation consists of two balls of noodle dropping into a bowl, with two chopsticks following behind. Then the noodles begin to let off some steam, appealing to the users as it gets them thinking of warm, delicious food. 

Noodles are the best!
